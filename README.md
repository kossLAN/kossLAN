## About Me

- Hey, I like FOSS software surrounding the linux desktop, and managing servers with [nix & nixos](https://nixos.org).
- I mostly use my own private [git instance](https://git.kosslan.dev) for my own projects, but most of my stuff is also available on GitHub aswell.
- If you'd like to contact me, please contact me using [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@kosslan:kosslan.dev).
